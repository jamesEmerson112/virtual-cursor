# Virtual Cursor - Circular Mouse Movement Automation

A Python-based automation tool that moves your mouse cursor in a perfect circle for a specified duration. Built with PyAutoGUI and designed with safety features and interrupt capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Circular Movement**: Smooth, mathematically precise circular mouse movement
- **Duration Control**: Configurable animation duration (default: 5 seconds)
- **Center Positioning**: Automatically centers the circle on current cursor position
- **Interrupt Safety**: Press ESC to immediately stop movement, or use Ctrl+C
- **Position Restoration**: Automatically returns cursor to starting position
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators during animation
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

1. Position your mouse cursor where you want the center of the circle to be
2. Run the script: `python circular_mouse.py`
3. Press ENTER when prompted to start the animation
4. Watch your cursor move in a perfect circle for 5 seconds
5. Press ESC at any time to interrupt the movement

## üìã Technical Details

### Configuration

Key parameters can be modified in `circular_mouse.py`:

```python
RADIUS = 100        # Circle radius in pixels
DURATION = 5.0      # Animation duration in seconds
FPS = 30           # Frames per second (smoothness)
```

### Mathematical Implementation

The circular movement uses parametric circle equations:
- `x = center_x + radius * cos(angle)`
- `y = center_y + radius * sin(angle)`

Where the angle increments smoothly over time to create fluid motion.

### Safety Features

- **Fail-safe Protection**: PyAutoGUI's built-in corner fail-safe
- **Keyboard Interrupts**: ESC key and Ctrl+C support
- **Position Restoration**: Returns cursor to original position
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and cleanup
- **User Confirmation**: Requires explicit confirmation before starting

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

- **PyAutoGUI** (‚â•0.9.54): Cross-platform GUI automation
- **keyboard** (‚â•0.13.5): Keyboard event detection for ESC interrupt

### System Requirements

| Platform | Additional Notes |
|----------|------------------|
| **macOS** | No additional setup required |
| **Windows** | No additional setup required |
| **Linux** | May require: `python3-tk`, `python3-dev`, `scrot`, `python3-xlib` |

## üéÆ Controls

| Key/Action | Function |
|------------|----------|
| **ENTER** | Start circular movement |
| **ESC** | Interrupt movement immediately |
| **Ctrl+C** | Force stop program |
| **Mouse to corner** | PyAutoGUI fail-safe activation |

## üìä Program Output

==================================================
Circular Mouse Movement Automation
==================================================

SAFETY NOTE: This script will control your mouse cursor.
Make sure you're ready before proceeding.
The cursor will move in a circle for 5 seconds.

Press ENTER to start the circular movement (or Ctrl+C to cancel)...

Starting circular movement centered at (640, 360)
Circle radius: 100 pixels
Duration: 5.0 seconds
Press ESC to interrupt the movement at any time...

Starting circular movement...
Time elapsed: 1.0s
Time elapsed: 2.0s
Time elapsed: 3.0s
Time elapsed: 4.0s
Time elapsed: 5.0s

Completed 5.0-second circular movement!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pyautogui keyboard
```

**Permission Errors on Linux:**
```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**macOS Security Permissions:**
- Grant accessibility permissions in System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Accessibility

**Movement Too Fast/Slow:**
- Modify the `FPS` constant in `circular_mouse.py`
- Higher FPS = smoother but more CPU intensive
- Lower FPS = less smooth but more efficient

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Screen Recording Demos**: Create smooth circular mouse movements for tutorials
- **Mouse Testing**: Test mouse hardware and software responsiveness
- **Automation Testing**: Verify cursor tracking in applications
- **Screensaver Prevention**: Keep system active during presentations
- **Accessibility Tools**: Automated mouse movement for accessibility needs

## üîÑ Customization Examples

### Change Circle Size
```python
RADIUS = 200  # Larger circle
```

### Longer Duration
```python
DURATION = 10.0  # 10-second animation
```

### Higher Smoothness
```python
FPS = 60  # Ultra-smooth 60 FPS movement
```

### Multiple Rotations
Modify the angle increment calculation:
```python
# For 3 complete rotations over duration
angle_increment = (6 * math.pi) / (DURATION * FPS)
```

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:
- Additional movement patterns (figure-8, spiral, etc.)
- GUI interface for parameter adjustment
- Multiple monitor support
- Movement recording and playback
- Speed ramping (slow start/stop)
